    "<h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4> We will be using the example dataset given by SDOT Traffic Management Division to predict the car accident severity of Seattle. This city is a place where rainfall is experienced for an average of 18 days/month and it also have high level of humidity and it makes it a perfect place for studying car accident severity due to the weather. Seattle had set a goal that by 2030 they'll have 0% of fatal or serious injuries for car accidents. Although these numbers have decreased through the years it seems very unlikely that the city will reach this goal for 2030. So the purpose of this project Y is to predict the severity of this accidents due to several variables so that the city can take actions accordingly."

This columns contains a vast amount of variables such as location, vehicle count, road condition and lightning condition, weather, collision type and many others. With these information we'll train the dataset to predict the accident severity due to most of this variables but most of it focused on the weather and road conditions. We'll need to separate this data set to a train dataset and a test dataset to have the best results possible."
